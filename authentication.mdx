# Smartcomply API Authentication Guide

Smartcomply provides secure and seamless authentication mechanisms to ensure that your interactions with our APIs are protected. Follow the steps below to authenticate your application and start making API requests.

## Obtain Your Secret Key

After completing your business KYC, you will be issued a secret key. This key is crucial for authenticating your API requests. Treat it with care and do not share it publicly.

## Authentication Method

Smartcomply uses an API key to secure API requests. You will need to include your secret key in the `Authorization` header of every API request.


- **Base URL (production):** `https://adhere-api.smartcomply.com`
- **media-type:** `application/json`

### HEADERS

### Sample Request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://adhere-api.smartcomply.com/api/v1/endpoint" \
-H "x-access-token: YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
```

## Best Practices

> Keep your secret key secure: Store it in environment variables and avoid hard-coding it in your application.
>
> Rotate keys periodically: To enhance security, consider rotating your API keys periodically.
>
> Use different keys for different environments: This helps in isolating issues and managing access control.
