## Face Liveliness Check
Face authentication with liveliness check

Liveliness check is a feature that ensures the person being authenticated is physically present and not just a photograph or video.

With this endpoint, users can provide their facial features as input to the system, which will then perform a liveliness check to ensure that the user is present and not just a still image or pre-recorded video. This ensures the security and reliability of the authentication process, as it reduces the risk of unauthorized access by fraudulent means.
