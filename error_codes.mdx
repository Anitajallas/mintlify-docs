Smartcomply uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:

- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed.

| **HTTP Code** | **Error**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **400**       | Bad Request     | The request was unacceptable, often due to:                                      |
|               |                 | 1. Missing a required parameter.                                                 |
