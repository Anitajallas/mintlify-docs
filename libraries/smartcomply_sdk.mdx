## Available Library/SDK for Quick Integration

The Adhere Web SDK provides a seamless, secure way to verify user presence (Liveness) and match their identity against official documents. Our SDK handles the heavy lifting of frame capture, face extraction, and secure transmission, while our backend uses AI to verify results asynchronously.

#### Getting started

To initialize the SDK, you will need:

- **Public API Key - `apiKey`:** Found in your Adhere Dashboard settings.
- **Configuration ID - `clientID`:** The unique ID for your specific liveness workflow.

#### Installation

For web applications, include our library via CDN or install it via NPM (upcoming).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.adhere.com/sdk/v1/liveness.js"></script>
```

#### Implementation

Initialize the verification engine by calling the sdk.launch() method. This launches a secure overlay that guides the user through the liveness challenges (e.g., blinking, head rotation) and document upload.

```javascript
const sdk = new AdhereSDK({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  clientID: "your-client-id",
  // Callback Props
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    console.log("Process complete!", data.entryId);
  },
  onError: (err) => {
    alert("Something went wrong: " + err.message);
  },
  onClose: () => {
    console.log("User exited the widget early.");
  },
});

// Launch SDK
document.getElementById("test-launch-btn").onclick = () => sdk.launch();
```

## Webhook Integration

Since face matching involves complex asynchronous processing, the final result is sent to your server via a Webhook.

#### Payload Schema

When the verification is complete, Adhere will send a POST request to your configured Webhook URL.

**Sample JSON Payload**

```JSON
{
  "event": "liveness.completed",
  "data": {
    "entry_id": 43,
    "status": "passed",
    "is_verified": true,
    "match_score": 0.31375,
    "metadata": {
      "user-agent": "",
      "ip_address": "192.168.0.1",
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-02-17T02:13:58Z"
}
```

#### Field definitions

| Field         | Description                                                               | Type      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `status`      | The status of the session (passed, failed, expired).                      | `string`  |
| `is_verified` | Whether we successfully matched the selfie to the ID.                     | `boolean` |
| `match_score` | The "Distance" between faces. Lower is better. Facenet threshold is 0.40. | `float`   |
| `entry_id`    | Unique identifier for this verification record.                           | `String`  |

#### Explaining the Match Score (Distance)

**Match score** is a measure of "how different" two faces are. It is represents the mathematical distance between the selfie and the ID. A lower score indicates a higher probability of a match. While our system flags is_verified: true for any score below `0.40`, we recommend a manual audit for any scores falling in the `Borderline` range (`0.40 - 0.50`) to account for extreme lighting or age differences in documents.

| Score Range     | Interpretation   | Action Recommended |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **0.0 - 0.25**  | Identical match  | Auto-Approve       |
| **0.25 - 0.40** | Strong match     | Auto-Approve       |
| **0.40 - 0.50** | Borderline match | **Manual Review**  |
| **0.50+**       | Different people | Reject             |

## Security & Best Practices

#### Verify the Source - Webhook Signatures

To ensure that webhook requests are coming from Adhere, we include an `X-Adhere-Signature` in the header of every request. You should verify this signature before processing the data.

**Verification Steps**

- Retrieve your `webhook_secret` from the Adhere Dashboard.

- Get the raw body of the POST request.

- Compute the HMAC hex digest using the SHA256 hash function and your secret key.

- Compare your computed signature with the one in the `X-Adhere-Signature` header.

**Example (Node.js/Express)**

```javascript
app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers["x-adhere-signature"];
  const secret = process.env.ADHERE_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

  const computedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(req.body))
    .digest("hex");

  if (signature === computedSignature) {
    // Legit request
    res.status(200).send("Verified");
  } else {
    // Possible spoofing attempt
    res.status(401).send("Invalid Signature");
  }
});
```

#### Handle Retries

Our systems expect a 200 OK response. If your server is down, we will retry the notification 3 times with exponential backoff (5, 15, and 30 minutes).
