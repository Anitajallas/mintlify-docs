### Overview
The Card Transaction Monitoring system performs real-time fraud assessments on all transactions executed through your card, designed to identify and mitigate risks. This system operates with high accuracy by applying advanced algorithms and leveraging real-time data analysis. Each transaction receives a fraud score, which is a calculated risk assessment indicating the probability of fraudulent behavior.

### How It Works
The monitoring process evaluates transactions based on:

- Algorithmic Analysis: Sophisticated algorithms examine multiple transaction characteristics, including location, transaction history, and spending patterns.
- Real-Time Data Analysis: The system utilizes up-to-the-moment data to capture potential fraudulent indicators instantly.
- Upon evaluation, the system assigns each transaction a fraud score, which can be used to decide further action, such as transaction flagging, manual review, or auto-rejection.
