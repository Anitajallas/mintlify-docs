## Retrieve Transaction Limit

This endpoint allows users to define maximum allowable values for specific transaction parameters, such as transaction amount or transaction frequency. By setting these limits, organizations can detect and manage unusual transaction behaviors more effectively. When a transaction exceeds the configured limit, it may either be flagged for review or automatically declined to mitigate potential fraud risks.
