### Overview
The Transaction Monitoring system is designed to provide real-time analysis and alerting for all transactions processed through your API account. It evaluates each transaction based on customizable rules, which are tailored to align with your specific requirements, helping to detect potentially suspicious or unusual activities indicative of fraud or security concerns. Alerts are generated when transactions exceed these thresholds, allowing you to take timely action and maintain control over your financial transactions.

### Key Features
- Customizable Rules: Transaction Monitoring is configured with flexible rules that you can tailor based on your risk tolerance and business needs. Common rule criteria include:
    - Transaction amount limits
    - Frequency of transactions
    - Geographic location
    - Merchant category
    - Time of day

- Automated Alerts: The system automatically triggers alerts when a transaction breaches any of the set rules. Alerts notify you of potential issues through channels such as email, SMS, or in-app notifications, providing prompt updates on any suspicious activity.
- Detailed Transaction Review: Once an alert is generated, you can review detailed information on the flagged transaction. This allows you to:
    - Approve or reject the transaction
    - Contact the merchant for more information
    - Escalate the issue to customer support if further investigation is needed
- Proactive Fraud Prevention: By utilizing real-time data analysis and customizable rules, the system enhances your ability to monitor transactions effectively and take proactive measures against potential fraud.
