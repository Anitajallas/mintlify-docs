Transaction screening is a process that evaluates each transaction against a set of predefined criteria to identify potentially suspicious or prohibited activities. This involves cross-checking transactions for:

- **Sanctioned Entities:** Identifying transactions involving entities on sanction lists.
- **High-Risk Countries:** Screening transactions associated with countries flagged as high-risk.
- **Suspicious Keywords:** Detecting keywords that may indicate fraudulent or suspicious behavior.

Transaction screening helps organizations maintain regulatory compliance, detect financial crime, and prevent transactions associated with illicit activity.
